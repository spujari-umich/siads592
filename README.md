## Motivation:
Approximately 1.3 million people die each year on the world's roads, and between 20 and
50 million sustain non-fatal injuries [1]. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their
gross domestic product. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and
young adults aged 5-29 years [2].
<br>We come from India and have first hand experience of frequent road accidents and related
fatalities. In 2019 alone there were 449 thousand crashes causing 151 thousand deaths and
451 thousand injuries [3]. That means, a crash is happening every one minute causing a
death every three minute in India.<b>This is huge.</b>
<br>Geo tagged data, needed for analysis is not yet available for India and hence we decided to
analyze the traffic crashes for New York.
<br>With the power of data science, we want to be able to study factors that contribute towards
accidents in the city of New York and suggest strategies that can be taken to reduce them.
The concepts taught in the MADS program so far in our curriculum can be applied well
towards the datasets we have found for this task.
